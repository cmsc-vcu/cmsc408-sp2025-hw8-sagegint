Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis

This assignment is going to make your head hurt with trying to figure out a lot of complex queries. Keeping open almost every lecture slide the professor has on canvas will be a requirement to remember all the different techniques for database retrieval and manipulation.

Overall, this assignment will strengthen your understanding of data aggregation and grouping, complex joins and subqueries, and handling null and missing data - sometimes you can't just update it when calculating percentages! 

This assignment uses vs code, sqltools, github, and github client.
